Abstract

    This PEP contains the index of all Python Enhancement Proposals,
    known as PEPs.  PEP numbers are assigned by the PEP editors, and
    once assigned are never changed.  The version control history of
    the PEP texts represent their historical record.

Introduction

    The PEP process begins with a new idea for Python.
